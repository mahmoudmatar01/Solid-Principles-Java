# SOLID Principles in Java

This repository provides examples and explanations of the SOLID principles using Java. SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that help software developers create more maintainable and scalable software.

## SOLID Principles Overview

SOLID is a set of five design principles that promote building maintainable and scalable software:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have only one reason to change.
- **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The SRP is all about making sure that a class has only one reason to change. This principle helps in keeping classes focused and makes them easier to maintain.


## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

The OCP suggests that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.


## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The LSP states that subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. In other words, if a class is a subtype of another class, it should be able to replace its parent class without causing issues.


## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The ISP advises that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It's about creating smaller, more focused interfaces for classes.


## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes the use of interfaces and dependency injection to decouple classes.
